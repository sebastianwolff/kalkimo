## AfA – Depreciation

Depreciation (AfA) is one of the most important tax benefits for real estate. It allows you to write off the acquisition costs of the building (not the land) over the useful life:

- **Built from 2023:** 3% per year (33.3 years)
- **Built 1925–2022:** 2% per year (50 years)
- **Built before 1925:** 2.5% per year (40 years)

## Deductible Expenses

As a landlord, you can claim numerous costs for tax purposes:

- Loan interest
- Renovation and maintenance costs
- Management costs
- Travel costs to the property
- Depreciation on furnishings

## §82b EStDV – Distribution of Maintenance Expenses

Larger maintenance expenses can be distributed over 2 to 5 years. This can be useful for landlords whose taxable income fluctuates.

## §23 EStG – Avoiding Capital Gains Tax

When selling a property within 10 years of acquisition, capital gains tax applies. After the 10-year period, the profit is tax-free (for private individuals). Since 2024, a €1,000 exemption threshold applies.
