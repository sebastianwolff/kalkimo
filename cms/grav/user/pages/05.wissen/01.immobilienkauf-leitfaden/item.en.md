## 1. Estimate Purchase Price & Acquisition Costs Realistically

A frequently underestimated item in cashflow calculations are the acquisition costs. Typically 10–15% of the purchase price apply: property transfer tax (3.5–6.5% depending on federal state), notary and land registry costs (~2%) and possibly broker commission (3–7%).

Example: For a purchase price of €300,000, ancillary costs can quickly reach €30,000–45,000. These costs must be included in the return calculation.

## 2. Plan the Financing Structure Carefully

The choice of financing has a significant impact on cashflow. Compare annuity loans with different terms, check KfW funding programs and calculate follow-up interest rates for the period after the fixed-rate period.

## 3. Calculate Rental Income Conservatively

Don't count on maximum rents. Factor in a vacancy rate of 2–5% and plan rent adjustments conservatively. The local rent index provides good guidance.

## 4. Don't Forget Maintenance Reserves

The rule of thumb recommends €1–1.50 per square meter per month for maintenance. For older buildings, the need can be significantly higher.

## 5. Consider Tax Aspects from the Start

Depreciation (AfA), income-related expenses and loss offsetting can significantly improve effective cashflow. Use a calculator like Kalkimo that correctly maps German tax logic.

## 6. Don't Overvalue Appreciation

Historical value increases are no guarantee for the future. Calculate your investment so that it works even without appreciation.

## 7. Analyze the Location Thoroughly

Location, location, location – this principle still applies. Check infrastructure, population development, economic strength and planned construction projects in the area.

## 8. Plan a Liquidity Reserve

Unexpected expenses always occur. Plan at least 3–6 months of rent as a reserve to avoid difficulties at the first unplanned repair.

## 9. Run Different Scenarios

Test your calculation with different assumptions: What happens with rising interest rates? With longer vacancy periods? With necessary renovations? Scenario analysis gives you confidence.

## 10. Use Professional Tools

Spreadsheets quickly reach their limits. A specialized real estate investment calculator like Kalkimo considers all relevant factors and helps you make informed decisions.
