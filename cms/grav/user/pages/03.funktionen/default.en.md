Kalkimo Planner provides bank-standard real estate investment calculations with complete German tax logic.

## Purchase Price & Acquisition Costs

Record the purchase price and all ancillary costs: property transfer tax, notary, land registry and broker – configurable by federal state.

## Financing

Model multiple loans simultaneously: annuity loans, KfW programs, fixed rate periods, follow-up interest rates and special repayments.

## German Tax Logic

Complete implementation of German tax law:

- **Depreciation** by construction year (2% / 2.5% / 3%)
- **Building/land separation** (land not depreciable)
- **15% rule** for acquisition-related construction costs
- **§82b EStDV** distribution of larger maintenance expenses (2–5 years)
- **§23 EStG** capital gains tax with 10-year holding period

## Cashflow & Liquidity

Monthly and annual cashflow projection over the entire holding period. Identify positive and negative phases early.

## Scenarios & Stress Tests

Compare optimistic, neutral and pessimistic scenarios. Test your investment against interest rate changes, vacancy and value developments.

## Renovation & Maintenance

Plan renovation measures with impact on rent and property value. Account for the effect of deferred maintenance as value depreciation.

## Multi-Investor

Split investments across multiple investors. Individual tax rates and capital shares are calculated correctly.

## Export

Create professional PDF reports and CSV exports for your bank, tax advisor or investors.
